# Simple Orbit Simulator

Simple simulator to run through an orbit given hardcoded parameters.

Also used to test vscode setup and functionality of fsml and git on home system.

Wanted functions:
Split Body into library rather than in main  
Use vector math rather than splitting distance into x and y  
Add functionality for more than one body being updated  
Add array to store all bodies, interate over all other bodies for each body to run full simulation  
Arrow keys to toggle one frame at a time?  
Figure out the timestep thing. Keep time steps constant, but at what rate
